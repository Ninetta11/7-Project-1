## Pinboard
Pinboard is an online school bulletin board that displays year group specific information for students. High school students are notoriously bad at remembering information and dates that are important to the running of everyday school life. This app is designed to provide school admin an simple and effective way to regularly post this information to students to one location so that it is easy to access and use for even the most unorganised teenager!

## Project Objective
To work collaboratively with others to create an application that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Agile development methodologies were used to implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests. 

## User Story

I AM an administrative staff member at a high school
I WANT the students to have easy access to:
* class timetable
* important notices
* canteen information
* Reading recommendations (Term Text)
* weather information and its impact on daily events
* extra curricular information
SO THAT the relevant information pertaining to school life is distributed to them in an effective and prompt manner.

## Application Requirements

* Must use at least two server-side APIs
* Must use a CSS framework (Bootstrap, Bulma, Materialize, etc... + Vanilla CSS)
* Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input) + local storage (if applicable)
* Use at least one new third-party API (something we have not used in class)
* Must have a polished, mobile-friendly (responsive) UI (User-Interface)
* Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming, etc)
* Does not use alerts, confirms or prompts (look into _modals_)
* Must be deployed to GitHub Pages
* All Team members should contribute!
